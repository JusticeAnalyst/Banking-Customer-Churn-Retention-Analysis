# Banking-Customer-Churn-Retention-Analysis
Data-Driven Insights for Customer Loyalty and Retention Strategy **Author: Justice Analyst** | Last Updated: 15 February 2026

##  Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of banking customer churn behaviour, retention drivers, and revenue exposure from attrition. It is structured across **two analytical pages** designed to help identify at-risk customers, understand churn patterns by geography and demographics, and guide targeted retention strategies.

##  Repository Contents

| File | Description |
| `Screenshot_Customer_Churn_Overview.png` | Page 1 – Churn distribution, geography, gender, and tenure segments |
| `Screenshot_Product_Value_Retention.png` | Page 2 – Activity vs churn, value segmentation, product engagement, and at-risk customer table |

##  Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
| Total Customers | 10,000 |
| Churn Rate | 20.37% |
| Retention Rate | 79.63% |
| Average Balance | $76,486 |
| Active Member Rate | 51.51% |
| Avg Balance (Churned) | $91K |
| Avg Balance (Retained) | $73K |

##  Dashboard Pages

### Page 1 – Customer & Churn Overview
Provides a high-level view of churn distribution across demographics and geography.

- **20.37%** of customers have churned, with **79.63%** retained
- **Germany** has the highest churn concentration at **32.44%**, significantly above Spain (16.67%) and France (16.15%)
- **Female customers churn more** than male customers — 25.07% vs 16.46%
- Churn rates are fairly consistent across tenure segments: New (21.15%), Growing (20.76%), and Loyal (19.67%), suggesting tenure alone is not a strong retention predictor

### Page 2 – Product, Value & Retention Drivers
Digs into behavioural and value-based drivers of churn.

- **Inactive members churn nearly twice as much** as active members — 26.85% vs 14.27%
- **High-value customers churn the most** at 25.23%, followed by Medium Value (19.88%) and Low Value (14.25%), highlighting significant revenue risk at the top of the customer base
- **Churned customers carry higher average balances ($91K)** than retained customers ($73K), amplifying the financial impact of attrition
- Customers with **only 1 product** show the highest churn risk; engagement increases with product count
- An **At-Risk Customer Monitoring Table** lists high-balance customers for targeted retention intervention

##  Key Insights
- **Germany is a critical churn hotspot** — more than 1 in 3 German customers churn, requiring a region-specific retention strategy
- **Female customers are disproportionately at risk** — a gender-targeted engagement approach could improve retention
- **Inactivity is a strong churn signal** — re-engagement campaigns for dormant members could meaningfully reduce churn
- **High-value customers churning at the highest rate** represents the largest revenue risk — these customers deserve priority retention attention
- **Product depth reduces churn** — customers with 2+ products are significantly less likely to leave, making cross-selling a key retention lever

##  Recommendations
1. **Launch a Germany-focused retention campaign** — investigate regional service gaps and tailor offerings to reduce the 32.44% churn rate
2. **Target female customers with personalised retention offers** — address the 25.07% churn rate through dedicated engagement programmes
3. **Re-engage inactive members** — proactive outreach to the 48.49% inactive base before they churn, given their nearly double churn rate
4. **Prioritise high-value customer retention** — introduce VIP programmes, dedicated relationship managers, or exclusive benefits for top-tier customers
5. **Drive cross-product adoption** — incentivise single-product customers to adopt a second, as product engagement is strongly associated with lower churn

##  Tools Used
- **Power BI** — Dashboard design, DAX measures, and interactive visualisations
- **Banking Customer Dataset** — 10,000 customer records covering balance, tenure, geography, activity, product usage, and churn status
